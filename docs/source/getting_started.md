# Getting Started

There are currently two reasonable ways to install and run Asypi. The first is to clone the repo into your project, which will bring the Asypi namespace into scope. The other is to clone the repo somewhere on your disk and link it to your project with `dotnet add reference`.

In the future, once Asypi is better tested, the plan is to release it on NuGet to allow easier installation.
