# Asypi Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/asypi/badge/?version=latest)](https://asypi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable)

Documentation is handled by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) and published by [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/). In case of confusion, both of these have great documentation on their respective websites.

Due to its better readability and ease-of-use, markdown is the preferred format for documentation.

Documentation source files are housed under `source/` and build files are housed under `build/`. Documentation can be built by running `make html` or `make.bat html` (depending on platform). The resulting html files will reside under `build/html/`.

When updated, documentation will be automatically rebuilt and published at [https://asypi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://asypi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
